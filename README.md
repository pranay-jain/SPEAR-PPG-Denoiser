# SPEAR-PPG-Denoiser
A self-supervised deep learning model for denoising Photoplethysmography signals

This repository will provide the code for implementing the SPEAR PPG Denoising Algorithm. This algorithm is based on the paper titled "A Self-Supervised Algorithm for Denoising Photoplethysmography Signals for Heart Rate Estimation from Wearables", which is currently under review. 

A written description of the denoising autoencoder model's implementation is provided in the Supplementary.pdf file. This description is not meant to be published with the paper, and as such, serves to provide the reader with the specific model architecture used in our algorithm. This will enable our model's reproducibility. The supplementary file also includes a discussion on ablation studies on different parts of the model. The file also provides several examples of the algorithm's denoising performance on real-world examples of PPG signals derived from public datasets.
